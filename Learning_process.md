## What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
The Feynman Technique is a learning method where we understand a concept in depth and explain it in a simple way.

## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The idea which I got interesting is that our brain works in two different modes.
1. Focused mode : when we concentrate hard on one thing and try to solve it step by step.
2. Diffuse mode : when our mind is relaxing (eg. walking)

    Learning doesn't happen when we sit and focus. sometimes we get best ideas when our brain is relaxing.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
1. Active mode : when we concentrate hard on one thing and try to solve it step by step.
2. Diffuse mode : when our mind is relaxing and not concentrating on one thing (eg. walking, relaxing, daydreaming)

## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
* Break Topics into Smaller parts.
