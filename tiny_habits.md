## Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The interesting idea from this video is: start with a small habits so small they are almost important. That habit should be so small that you can't say "I don't have time". And changes doesn't come from big resolutions, but from tiny actions.

## Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

* M = Motivation — how much you want or care to do the habit. 
* A = Ability — how easy it is to do the habit (time, effort)
* P = Prompt — a trigger that tells you “now’s the time” (for example, a reminder).

To build a new habit using B = MAP, choose something you actually want to do (Motivation), make it very easy (Ability), and connect it to a reminder or routine that triggers it (Prompt). When all three are in place, the habit becomes much easier to do.

## Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating after doing a habit makes you feel good, and that positive feeling trains your brain to want to do the habit again.

## Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea was that getting just 1% better every day can lead to big improvements over time. Small steps can create huge results.

## Question 5
What is the book's perspective about Identity?

* The book says habits aren’t just about what you do — they shape who you are.
* Change starts with identity: decide what kind of person you want to be before focusing on result.
* Every time you do a habit, you are casting a “vote” for that identity. Repeating the habit builds proof that you are that person.

* Make the habit small
* Reduce the effort
* Break it into tiny steps
* Make the environment help you

## Question 7
