## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?
* The idea of over-communicating intentionally.
* Using tools like Loom, GitHub Gists, CodeSandbox to ask better questions was a useful and practical takeaway.
* Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

* I need to improve on asking clear and well-structured questions when I’m stuck.

* To make progress:

    * I will clearly explain the problem and its expected behavior.
    * I will list the solutions I’ve already tried before asking for help.
    * I will try to check documentation or similar issues before reaching out.
